  - I have been getting any needed data from the store inside the container file for my module by dispatching actions imported from my ducks file.

  - The graphl queries and mutations that interact with the API are set up in the Ducks files.  Good examples of those are inside the tests.  I have been gradually rewriting the tests to use graphql variables in the correct manner.  One good example is the createField test inside fields graphql test.
