Postgres needs to be running on host machine. 9.5.4 on Mac was used for development.

Create a new Postgres DB named relay_test for testing, and relay for production.

npm start to start server

npm run seed to seed development server

npm run test to run tests

To run an individual sequelize test, example;
NODE_ENV=testing mocha test/sequelize/db.project.test.js --compilers js:babel-core/register --require babel-polyfill

To run and individual graphql test, example;
NODE_ENV=testing mocha test/graphql/graphql.field.noServer.test.js --compilers js:babel-core/register --require babel-polyfill
